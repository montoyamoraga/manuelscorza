The Mayans who abandonded their prodigious cities
every fifty-two years
because of unknown reasons
all the katunes waited for the end of the world,
they never unveil their true names.
They would risk having their souls stolen!
The Mayans honored, nevertheless, the "masters
of the words".
Pleasantly
they offered
cocoa, precious currency,
to the words forgers
more resistant than the stones of their
abolished pyramids.
Let's praise poetry, let's praise love,
let's praise friendship!
What a pity, Hans Magnus, that you are not
in the corolla of this summer
in whose terrace
Cecilia and Sofía walk, better than these grapes
but not better than my daughter
who is a hundred days old
and who will last more than Napoleon's government.
Let's celebrate poetry, let's celebrate love,
let's celebrate friendship!
Life is short.
"Life happens like the Azores islands", lamented
Maiakovski.
And what else gives?
I accept that mi body
will be a feast for the beetles,
on condition of transforming myself
in tree
and then
in butterfly
and then
in lichen
and then in light.
There is a fly who sniffs from five kilometers away
the smell of death
and flies
straight to the bed of the dying.
It is okay.
But there is also the sun,
the wine
and the bodies of our women!
And our craft: we collected words.
The word
is a turret
from which it is watched
tenaciously the night
and meanwhile comes the time of combat,
like in all the garrisons
we play cards, we drink, we fornicate, we laugh
out loud at the cold
that one day will go through that door waving its
marshal cane.
Today we will walk across the forest, we will look
for a guitar,
we will bathe in forbidden ponds.
Life is shit, life is sublime.
And Cecilia and Sofía know it.
And more than anybody my daughter
who has slanted eyes,
the eyes of her Mongolian great grandfather who shivering crossed
the Behring strait
more than in his igloo warming up
with the fires that lighted up his
word collectors.
The word!
That astonished Atahualpa.
When Hernando de Soto galloped at him and
stopped his horse one meter away from his sacred person,
the Divine didn't move
and then ordered to hang
the cowards who escaped from the prodigious monster
like chicken feathers
but when he met the books,
"the papers that spoke"
he fainted.
What a pity, Hans Magnus,
that you are not here with us
biting not into peaches but enigmas,
or going through
your childhood
or my childhood
or simply hearing the wind
the wind that will blow away the walls,
the men, the beasts, the words, the dreams.
